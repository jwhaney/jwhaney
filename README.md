### _"Well, now Lord, if you can hear me won't you throw a damn dog a bone_
### _'Cause if the Devil shows up with a better deal this old soul's a-goin' down_
### _Oh, I sing 'em real pretty, sing 'em real sad_
### _And all the people in the crowd say 'He ain't half bad'_
### _Well, they call me King Turd up here on Shit Mountain_
### _If you want it you can have the crown"_
