### _"Opinions of minions. False dominions. No time, To feel what's real. Talking, talking never listening. Always elsewhere. Searching, searching but there's nothing to be found. Touch, taste, look, smell, you can hear this right now. You think so much you can't feel the harmony of a trillion cells."_
### _"Always elsewhere. No time To feel what's real."_
